# osu Web Replays

osu Web Replays is a tool to allow to watch [osu!](http://osu.ppy.sh/) replays in your browser.

## Getting Started

The website can be accessed [here](https://ugrend.github.io/mmmyeh).

By default it has no access to any assets/beatmaps/etc.
Replays/Beatmaps/Skins can be loaded by dragging the .osr/.osz/.osk archives into the browser.  
If you load a replay that you do not have the beatmap available locally it will attempt to download a copy of the map, however no assets will be provided (eg no song)

You can also drag in asset files separately (eg: if you drag in a .mp3 for a map the song will now load for that map automatically)

__Disclaimer:__ Any map(excluding assets)/replay you drag in gets automatically uploaded to an API, so if you have something top secret I would suggest not draging it in ;)  

#### Skins:
I would highly suggest using a custom skin package as the default is not great and unfinished.  
You can do this by dragging in a osk file and once finished refresh the page, you only have to do this once.

### Browser Support
This was developed using Chrome 54 but also tested to work on Firefox 50  
Does **NOT** work on IE  
Kinda works on Edge however is very sluggish, Safari is even worse.  
Officially only supporting Chrome/Firefox

(It also works on Chrome on Android but you will encounter no sound atm, as well as scaling issues)


#### Linking replays
When you load a replay, the url will change allowing you to link that replay to someone else eg: https://ugrend.github.io/mmmyeh/?r=gVQ1V  
You can link at a specific point by adding ```t=1m10s``` eg:  https://ugrend.github.io/mmmyeh/?r=gVQ1V&t=1m10s

To auto play the replay you can add ```ap=1``` or ```ap=t``` eg: https://ugrend.github.io/mmmyeh/?r=gVQ1V&t=1m10s&ap=1
### Development

You will need gruntjs and node.js

```
cd src
npm install
```
Once packages have been installed  you can build it With
```
grunt build
```
Alternatively you can run ```grunt watch``` to have it monitor for changes
